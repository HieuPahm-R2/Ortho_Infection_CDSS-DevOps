# Execution Plan: Upgrade repository-harness

Date: 2026-08-30

## Status

Completed

## Outcome

Upgrade the Harness managed payload from 0.1.7 to 0.1.10 while preserving local GitNexus guidance.

## Scope

In scope:

- Harness core, managed workflow/docs, and skills.
- Preservation of local content outside the Harness base.

Out of scope:

- Application code and product behavior.

## Approach

1. Back up local managed-file deviations.
2. Install the 0.1.10 managed base.
3. Restore local GitNexus guidance.
4. Verify Harness status.

## Risks And Recovery

- Managed documentation replacement: restore the timestamped upgrade backup.

## Progress

- [x] Upgrade and preserve local additions.
- [x] Verify Harness status.

## Validation

- Focused proof: `scripts/bin/harness.exe status`.

## Result

Harness core is 0.1.10 and both local GitNexus guidance blocks were preserved. The previous managed state is backed up under `.harness-upgrade-backup/20260830170050/`.
